In software development, a build is the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so
Building software is an end-to-end process that involves many distinct functions

    Version control(function)

        carries out activities such as workspace creation and updating, baselining and reporting. 
        It creates an environment for the build process to run in and captures metadata about the inputs and output 
        of the build process to ensure repeatability and reliability

    Code quality

        comments, unit tests, duplication, complexity, coding rules, potential bugs and architecture & design

    Compilation

        turns source files into directly executable or intermediate objects. Not every project will require this function


Build 

    a compiled version of a program

Compiling

    to convert (a program) into a machine-code or lower-level form in which the program can be executed
    Many compilers handle the linking step automatically after compiling source code
    the act of turning source code into intermediate object code

Linking 

    the act of combining object code with libraries into a raw executable

Building 

    the sequence composed of compiling and linking, with possibly other tasks such as installer creation
    testing

Packaging

    webpack etc

Running health checks

    Health check functions tell us the status of our running application like whether the service is slow or not available

Generating reports

    how many warnings and errors occurred during the build
