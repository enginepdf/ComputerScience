By default, web browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain. When the number of resources to download exceeds that limit, 

users experience slow page load times as downloads are queued.

developers may split content across multiple subdomainsmain which lets the user retrieve files from the same source with greater throughput.

With domain sharding, the userâ€™s browser connects to two or more different domains to simultaneously download the resources needed to render the web page.

Modern web browsers support on average 6 concurrent downloads per domain

YouTube splits images and script resources across two domains: i.ytimg.com and s.ytimg.com. 

    i.ytimg.com contains icons, logos, thumbnails, avatars, and other visual elements 
    while s.ytimg.com contains JavaScript, CSS, favicons, sprite sheets, and objects related to website optimization and analytics. 
    Users visiting youtube.com will simultaneously download the scripts and media needed to render the page
